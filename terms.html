              The KLIX app stores and processes personal data that you have

              to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
              recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is
              the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
              imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could
              make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
              compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
              the KLIX app won’t work properly or at all.

              You should be aware that there are certain things that PT Cipta
              Teknologi Aplikasi will not take responsibility for. Certain
              functions of the app will require the app to have an active
              internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by
              your mobile network provider, but PT Cipta Teknologi Aplikasi
              cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
              functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
              have any of your data allowance left.
            </p>
            <p class="my-10">
              If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
              remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
              provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
              mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
              connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges.
              In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
              charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside
              of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
              off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
              which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
              you have received permission from the bill payer for using the
              app.
            </p>
            <p class="my-10">
              Along the same lines, PT Cipta Teknologi Aplikasi cannot always
              take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
              make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
              battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, PT Cipta
              Teknologi Aplikasi cannot accept responsibility.
            </p>
            <p class="my-10">
              With respect to PT Cipta Teknologi Aplikasi’s responsibility for
              your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
              bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
              updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to
              provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
              PT Cipta Teknologi Aplikasi accepts no liability for any loss,
              direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly
              on this functionality of the app.
            </p>
            <p class="my-10">
              At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
              available on Android – the requirements for the system(and for any
              additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
              to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you
              want to keep using the app. PT Cipta Teknologi Aplikasi does not
              promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
              to you and/or works with the Android version that you have
              installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
              updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish
              to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
              without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
              otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses
              granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using
              the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
